A minimalist Ocarina of Time Multiworld Auto-Tracker. Built to have plugin-based autotracker support using Modloader64, this tracker is designed for up-to-date fun-run! Any users using the same plugin and tracker will be automatically updated regarding your progress, and can see what locations they have left! Upon uploading a spoiler log, you can see any locations associated with *your* world in other worlds. This allows you to get a general idea of your potential progression options. The spoiler-log information is limited the world's currently accessible locations, so you won't get over spoiled.

This tracker is completely open-source along with the plugin associated with it - so please contribute if you'd like! I'm always looking for outside views on UX and feature sets. If you want to contribute immediately, please take a look at the Issues page where all of my present ideas for changes and updates are always listed - more to come in later times.
