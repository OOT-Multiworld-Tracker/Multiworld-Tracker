# Multiworld-Tracker
[![CI](https://github.com/OOT-Multiworld-Tracker/Multiworld-Tracker/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OOT-Multiworld-Tracker/Multiworld-Tracker/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Usage
If you want to launch the application without the autotracking electron client, you may use `node .` to launch a browser-only copy accessible via port 8081. To use the electron client, you can launch it via `electron .` or `npx electron .`. This version of the client supports autotracking and world autofill.

If you wish to just use the application as normal, simply run the setup EXE and it'll open as an application on your computer.

## Features
- Multiworld ***AutoTracking!!*** (Currently only your held items)
- Minimal Spoiler Location View (See only the items you can access at that time)
- Search for locations by keywords (e.g Ocarina Saria)
- View your friends' progress in Multiworld

A minimalist Ocarina of Time Multiworld Auto-Tracker. Built to have plugin-based autotracker support using Modloader64, this tracker is designed for up-to-date fun-run! Any users using the same plugin and tracker will be automatically updated regarding your progress, and can see what locations they have left! 

Upon uploading a spoiler log, you can see any locations associated with *your* world in other worlds. This allows you to get a general idea of your potential progression options. The spoiler-log information is limited the world's currently accessible locations, so you won't get over spoiled.

This tracker is completely open-source along with the plugin associated with it - so please contribute if you'd like! I'm always looking for outside views on UX and feature sets. 
If you want to contribute immediately, please take a look at the Issues page where all of my present ideas for changes and updates are always listed - more to come in later times.
